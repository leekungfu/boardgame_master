# Specification Quality Checklist: Typography, Per-Phase Undo & Calm Color Palette

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec covers three independently testable user stories: per-phase undo (P1), calm palette (P2), typography (P3).
- Two clarifications were surfaced to the user (palette base light vs dark; undo scope depth). The spec records reasonable defaults in Assumptions so it remains valid regardless of the answers; answers will refine US2 and US1 respectively during `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
